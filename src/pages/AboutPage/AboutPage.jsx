I started making stickers as a fun side project to blah blah blah creating things for the properties my wife and I enjoy blah blah. When I'm not creating art, you can find me bulding GunPla kits, organizing Pokemon cards, and blah blah blah. I also accept commissions: past projects include custom Pokemon cards, OC portraits, and sweater designs from properties like Yugi-Oh! and Digimon.  </p>
